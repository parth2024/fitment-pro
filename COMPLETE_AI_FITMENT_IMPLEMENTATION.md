## 4. Data Flow

### Upload Product Data Flow

```
1. User uploads product file in Products tab
2. File validated and parsed
3. Products stored in ProductData table
4. User clicks "Proceed to AI Fitments"
5. Auto-redirects to Apply Fitments with AI selected
6. User chooses "Upload Product Data"
7. Upload file → AI processes → Job created
8. AI matches products with VCDB vehicles
9. Generates AiGeneratedFitment records
10. Job status → 'review_required'
11. User reviews fitments in table
12. User approves/rejects fitments
13. Approved → moved to Fitment table
14. All reviewed → Job status 'completed'
```

### Select Products Flow

```
1. User navigates to Apply Fitments
2. Selects AI Fitments → Select Products
3. Searches and selects products from catalog
4. Clicks "Apply AI Fitments"
5. AI processes selected products
6. Same review/approval flow as above
```

## 5. Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **data_uploads_aifitmentjob**

   - Tracks AI fitment generation jobs
   - Indexes on tenant+status, created_at

2. **data_uploads_aigeneratedfitment**

   - Stores generated fitments pending review
   - Indexes on job+status, confidence

3. **data_uploads_productdata**

   - Product catalog
   - Unique constraint on part_id+tenant

4. **data_uploads_vcdbdata**
