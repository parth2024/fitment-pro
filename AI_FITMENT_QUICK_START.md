## Job Statuses

| Status             | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| üîµ Queued          | Job created, waiting for Celery worker          |
| üîÑ Processing      | Celery task running (validating, AI processing) |
| üü† Review Required | Fitments ready for your review                  |
| ‚úÖ Completed       | All fitments reviewed and approved              |
| ‚ùå Failed          | Error occurred (check error message)            |

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create AI fitment job"

- Check if Celery worker is running
- Check Redis connection
- Check Django logs

### "No VCDB data available"

- Ensure VCDB data is uploaded
- Check tenant has VCDB categories configured
- Verify tenant ID in header

### Job stuck in "Processing"

- Check Celery worker logs
- Check if Azure AI service is responding
- Task timeout is 30 minutes - large files may take time

### Fitments not appearing after approval

- Check if fitments were successfully approved (refresh Jobs tab)
- Check Fitment Management page
- Check tenant filter

## File Format Requirements

### Product File (CSV/XLSX/JSON)

**Required Fields:**

- `id` or `part_id` - Unique product identifier
- `description` - Product description

**Optional Fields:**

- `category` - Product category
- `part_type` or `partType` - Type of part
- `brand` - Manufacturer/brand
- `sku` - Stock keeping unit
- `compatibility` - Compatibility notes
- `specifications` - JSON object with specs

**Example CSV:**

```csv
id,description,category,brand
P001,Front Brake Pads,Brakes,Brembo
P002,Oil Filter,Engine,K&N
```

**Example JSON:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "P001",
    "description": "Front Brake Pads",
    "category": "Brakes",
    "brand": "Brembo"
  }
]
```

## Real-Time Progress

The frontend polls the job status every 3 seconds and displays:

- Current progress percentage (0-100%)
- Status messages from Celery task
- Success/failure notifications
- Fitments count when complete

## Performance Notes

- Small files (< 100 products): ~30 seconds
- Medium files (100-500 products): 1-3 minutes
- Large files (500-1000 products): 3-10 minutes
- Very large files (> 1000 products): 10+ minutes

Progress is shown in real-time, so you can monitor the job.
