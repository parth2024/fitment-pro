# AI Fitment Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete AI-powered fitment management system where users can upload vehicle and product data, generate fitments using AI, review and approve them, and export the results.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints (Django)

#### New Endpoints Added:

- `GET /api/ai-fitments/` - Retrieve AI-generated fitments for a session
- `GET /api/applied-fitments/` - Get all applied fitments (with optional session filter)
- Enhanced `GET /api/export/` - Export fitments in CSV, XLSX, or JSON formats

#### Existing Endpoints Enhanced:

- `POST /api/upload-fitment-files/` - Upload VCDB and Products files
- `POST /api/ai-fitment/` - Process AI fitment generation
- `POST /api/apply-ai-fitments/` - Apply selected AI fitments to database
- `GET /api/session/{session_id}/status/` - Get session status

### 2. Frontend Components Enhanced

#### ApplyFitments.tsx

- **File Upload Section**: Upload VCDB and Products files with progress tracking
- **Method Selection**: Choose between Manual or AI fitment methods
- **AI Processing**: Generate fitments using Azure AI Foundry
- **AI Review Modal**:
  - Large modal (90% width) for better visibility
  - Summary statistics showing confidence levels
  - Detailed table with checkboxes for selection
  - AI reasoning display for each fitment
  - Export options (CSV, XLSX, JSON)
  - Apply selected fitments functionality

#### Fitments.tsx

- **AI Generated Fitments Section**:
  - Dedicated section with violet theme
  - Summary statistics (total, unique parts, unique vehicles)
  - Enhanced table with actions menu
  - Export functionality for AI fitments
  - Visual distinction from regular fitments

### 3. AI Service Integration

#### Azure AI Service Features:

- **Smart Prompting**: Creates detailed prompts with vehicle and product data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each fitment includes confidence level (0-1)
- **AI Reasoning**: Provides explanation for each fitment suggestion
- **Fallback System**: Rule-based generation when AI is unavailable
- **Data Validation**: Ensures proper data structure and required fields

#### AI Response Structure:

```json
{
  "partId": "WHEEL001",
  "partDescription": "18\" Alloy Wheel",
  "year": 2020,
  "make": "Toyota",
  "model": "RAV4",
  "submodel": "XLE",
  "driveType": "AWD",
  "position": "Front",
  "quantity": 4,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "ai_reasoning": "Compatible wheel for this vehicle"
}
```

### 4. Database Models

#### FitmentUploadSession

- Tracks file upload sessions
- Stores VCDB and Products file references
- Records processing status

#### AIFitmentResult

- Stores AI-generated fitment suggestions
- Includes confidence scores and reasoning
- Tracks selection and application status

#### AppliedFitment

- Stores approved and applied fitments
- Links to original AI results
- Includes application metadata

### 5. Export Functionality

#### Supported Formats:

- **CSV**: Standard comma-separated values
- **XLSX**: Excel format with formatting
- **JSON**: Structured data format

#### Export Features:

- Session-specific or all fitments
- Proper file naming and MIME types
- Browser download handling

## User Workflow

### 1. Upload Files

1. User uploads VCDB data file (CSV/XLSX/JSON)
2. User uploads Products data file (CSV/XLSX/JSON)
3. System validates and parses files
4. Session is created with file references

### 2. AI Processing

1. User selects "AI Fitment" method
2. System calls Azure AI Foundry with vehicle and product data
3. AI generates fitment suggestions with confidence scores
4. Results are stored in database

### 3. Review and Approval

1. AI results are displayed in review modal
2. User can see:
   - Part details and vehicle information
   - Confidence scores (color-coded)
   - AI reasoning for each suggestion
   - Summary statistics
3. User checks/unchecks fitments to approve/reject
4. User can export results before applying

### 4. Apply Fitments

1. User clicks "Apply Selected Fitments"
2. Selected fitments are moved to AppliedFitment table
3. AI results are marked as applied
4. Success message shows count of applied fitments

### 5. View and Export

1. Applied fitments appear in Fitments page
2. Dedicated AI Generated Fitments section
3. Export options available for all formats
4. Statistics and summary information displayed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Services

```typescript
export const fitmentUploadService = {
  uploadFiles: (vcdbFile: File, productsFile: File) => Promise,
  processAiFitment: (sessionId: string) => Promise,
  applyAiFitments: (sessionId: string, fitmentIds: string[]) => Promise,
  getAiFitments: (sessionId: string) => Promise,
  getAppliedFitments: (sessionId?: string) => Promise,
  exportFitments: (format: "csv" | "xlsx" | "json", sessionId?: string) =>
    Promise,
};
```

### Backend Views

- RESTful API design with proper error handling
- File upload handling with validation
- AI service integration with fallback
- Database operations with proper serialization
- Export functionality with multiple formats

### UI/UX Features

- Responsive design with mobile support
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Color-coded confidence levels
- Intuitive checkbox selection
- Export buttons with proper file handling
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Benefits

1. **Automated Fitment Generation**: AI reduces manual work
2. **Quality Control**: User review ensures accuracy
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Helps users make informed decisions
4. **Export Flexibility**: Multiple formats for different use cases
